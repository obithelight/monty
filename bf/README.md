# Brainf*ck 

`Brainfuck` is an esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. It is designed to be minimalistic and Turing complete, meaning it can theoretically perform any computation that can be done by other programming languages, albeit in a highly unconventional and terse manner.

The language consists of only eight simple commands, making it one of the smallest programming languages. The commands are:

`>` Increment the data pointer.
`<` Decrement the data pointer.
`+` Increment the byte at the data pointer.
`-` Decrement the byte at the data pointer.
`.` Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.
`,` Input a character and store it in the byte at the data pointer.
`[` Jump forward to the command after the corresponding `]` if the byte at the data pointer is 0.
`]` Jump back to the command after the corresponding `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.

`Brainfuck` operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. It uses the data pointer to navigate through these cells and performs operations based on the commands given.

Due to its minimalistic nature and unusual syntax, Brainfuck is often used for educational purposes, code golf (writing programs with the shortest possible source code), and as a challenge for programming enthusiasts.
